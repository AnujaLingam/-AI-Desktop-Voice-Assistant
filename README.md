Overview: Developed a Python-based AI virtual assistant similar to Jarvis from Iron Man. The virtual assistant was designed to perform various tasks based on voice commands, enhancing user convenience and productivity.

Roles and Responsibilities:

Project Initiation: Started the project by setting up the development environment, including downloading and configuring VS Code and Python IDLE.
Voice Interaction: Defined key functions for voice interaction, including a "Speak" function to enable voice output, a "Wishme" function to greet users based on the system time, and a "Take command" function to receive voice commands and provide responses.
Coding Logic: Implemented the core logic for the virtual assistant, allowing it to understand and execute user commands.
Task-Specific Functions: Developed several task-specific functions:
Task 1: Enabled the assistant to search for information on Wikipedia.
Task 2: Opened the YouTube website in the default browser.
Task 3: Opened the Google website in the default browser.
Task 4: Enabled music playback based on user preferences.
Task 6: Opened the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) program for coding tasks.
Task 7: Configured the assistant to send emails, including specifying recipients and email content.
Technologies and Tools:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Python
Voice Recognition and Speech Synthesis Libraries
Wikipedia API
